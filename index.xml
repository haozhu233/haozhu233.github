      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data nerd and software developer working in a research institute in Boston. I enjoy write codes online and make contributions to the open source community.
If you have ever wondered what 233 means, it means :D on Internet in China.
Another funny thing about my name, after I come to the US and switched the order of my name (in China, last name goes first), it started to sounds like porcupine in Chinese.</description>

      <title>What’s New in kableExtra 0.7.0</title>

      <description>kableExtra 0.7.0 is on CRAN now. This update includes quite a few long-waited new features, including immediate display of HTML table in the Viewer panel and a remake for footnote (in replacement for add_footnote), and some important bug fixes.
New Features Live view of HTML table in RStudio HTML tables generated through kableExtra now has its own class and will be previewed in the Viewer panel when it’s printed. I personally have wanted this feature for a long time.</description>

      <title>When do you need a portable Shiny App?</title>

      <description>Last year, Lee Pang wrote an amazing tutorial on how to set up a Desktop Shiny App with the portable version of R and Chrome. That post helped me a lot this year when I was trying to do a big proof-of-concept project to introduce shiny into the data management workflow in my work place. Now thanks to the success of that project, my institution is moving towards the server version of shiny and I would like to share some experiences I got during this progress in my recent posts before I say goodbye to this method.</description>

      <title>&#34;Build&#34; a reproducible report, instead of &#34;writing&#34; one</title>

      <description>(This blog post is largely built upon the inspiration I got after reading the 2nd chapter of Code Complete 2, which is a very practical book even for someone like me, who came into this field without a computer science background. I would highly recommend any data analysts or statistians who do a lot of programming works to read it.) 
To some extent, the development of Rmarkdown (and knitr) is really revolutionary for scientific researches.</description>

      <title>How to apply the MVVM pattern in reproducible research?</title>

      <description>The penalty for a mistake on a simple structure is only a little time and maybe some embarrassment.
More Complicated structures require more careful planning.
&amp;ndash; Steve McConnell in Code Complete 2
 If you are using Rmarkdown just to build a simple instruction or a blog post, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about your code structure at all. Mistakes in this kind of small projects are easy to be fixed.</description>

      <title>REDCap API and R Shiny</title>

      <description>REDCap, as says on its website, is a &amp;ldquo;mature and secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases&amp;rdquo;. It is used in many clinical researches as the database and the database management tool. One of the benefits of combining the usage of REDCap and R is that REDCap has an API (application programming interface), which can be used to easily export and import data into R. In this way, it can reduce the burden of data transformation and reduce possible human mistakes.</description>
